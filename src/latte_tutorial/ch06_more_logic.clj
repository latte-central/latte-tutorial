;; # More logic bits
;;
;; Logic is  not just about propositional operators like `and`, `or`, etc.
;; In this part of the tutorial, we'll see three other important logical
;; concepts: (various forms of) *equality*, the *existential* quantifier,
;; and finally we'll talk about the perhaps slightly less famous but
;; highly important concept of a *definite description*, also known
;; as the "iota" (Î¹) quantifier.
