;;{
;; In this short chapter I will quickly explain how to
;; install LaTTe and start to work with it.
;; 
;; If you are a seasoned Clojure programmer, there is
;; in fact nothing that distinguishes the installation
;; of LaTTe and the installation of any leiningen-powered
;; Clojure library.
;; 
;; Other build tools, such as boot or deps, could be used
;; but I am personally enjoying working with leiningen and
;; find it also a fantastic build tool for mathematical
;; developments !
;;
;;}

;;{
;; ## Step 1: the project structure
;;
;; I will take the current `latte-tutorial` project as an example.
;; I have created the basic directory structure with leiningen, using
;; something like the following:
;;
;; ```
;; $ lein new app latte-tutorial
;; ```
;; (note that the `$` symbol represents the Shell prompt)
;; 
;; I use the `app` template because as you'll see in the final chapter
;; we will write a `main` function in the final chapter of the tutorial.
;; 
;; After some cleanup I get a `latte-tutorial/` root directory
;; with the following contents:
;; - `project.clj` the leiningen project file
;; - `src/latte_tutorial/` the source files (`.clj` or `.clj.md` extensions)
;; - `LICENSE`, `README.md` some auxiliary files
;; 
;;}

;;{
;; ## Step 2: the project files
;; 
;; As for any leiningen the `project.clj` file contains the
;; build informations of our project, in particular its dependencies.
;; 
;; At the time of writing the document, the file contains the following
;; informations:
;; 
;; ```clojure
;; (defproject latte-tutorial "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
;;   :description "A gentle introduction to the LaTTe proof assistant."
;;   :url "https://github.com/latte-central/latte-tutorial"
;;   :license {:name "MIT License"
;;             :url "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"}
;;   :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.9.0"]
;;                  [latte "1.0"]
;;                  [latte-prelude "1.0"]
;;                  [latte-sets "1.0"]
;;                  [latte-integers "1.0"]])
;; ```
;; The `:dependencies` key is most interesting.
;; We first require the Clojure implementation itself, of course.
;; And our LaTTe dependencies are as follows:
;; - The core `latte` implementation, which provides the main user interface
;;   of the proof assistant. It itself depends on the `latte-kernel` project which
;;   implements the type theory used in LaTTe
;; - the `latte-prelude` standard library, which provides the fundamental reasoning
;; tools such as propositional operators, equality, quantifiers, etc.
;; - the `latte-sets` library of (typed) set theory, which we will use in the tutorial
;; - the `latte-integers` arithmetic library, which we will also discuss
;; 
;; To be sure that everything's fine regarding the dependencies, you might try the
;; following on the command line:
;; 
;; ```
;; $ lein deps
;; ```
;; 
;; In case there is a problem with the dependencies, some error message will be
;; printed out. Otherwise, if nothing happens, you're good to go!
;;}

;;{
;; ## Step 3: coding mathematics
;; 
;; In this final step, we begin our work with LaTTe. As for any Clojure program
;; we simply have to create a namespace source file with the `.clj` extension
;; and start coding.
;; 
;; We will proceed to the file `src.latte_tutorial.ch02_game_rules.clj` corresponding
;; to the namespace `latte-tutorial.ch02-game-rules` in which we'll start coding
;; mathematics.
;; 
;; Please proceed ...
