;; # Chapter 2: The rules of the game

;; We are now ready to begin our first mathematical development
;; in LaTTe. This will be in a `ch02-game-rules` namespace whose
;; declaration is as follows:
;;}


(ns latte-tutorial.ch02-game-rules

  ;;{
  ;; In this namespace we will only play with (lambda-)terms and types,
  ;; so we require only very few top-level forms from the `core` namespace.
  ;;}
  (:require [latte.core :refer [term type-of type-check?]]))
;; => nil

;;{
;; **Remark**: the `nil` returned by the `ns` form is in general quite a good
;; thing. It means that the requirements are satisfied.
;;}

;;{
;; ## Lambda the ultimate
;; 
;; One assumption I make is that you, the reader, you know the "pure" (i.e. untyped) lambda-calculus.
;; This is not a very strong assumption because you can find it right at the core of you favorite
;; programming language.  Indeed, in Clojure the `lambda` is called `fn`, which we use to define
;; anonymous functions. Note that `fn` corresponds to (the classical) `lambda` only if it accepts
;; a single parameter.
;; 
;; As a trivial example consider the identity function:
;; 
;; ```clojure
;; (fn [x] x)
;; ```
;; 
;; This function can be applied to anything to yield the very *same* anything:
;;}

((fn [x] x) 42)
;; => 42

((fn [z] z) :anything)
;; => :anything

;;{
;; We also show that the variables, e.g. `x`, `z`, can be renamed without changing
;; the function, it's still the identity function (unless there's some clash in the renaming).
;; In the set of useful functions, this is maybe the simplest of all and it even deserve
;; a name in the standard Clojure library:
;;}

(identity 42)
;; => 42

;;{
;; As a second, slightly more complex example, consider the composition of two functions
;; `f` and `g`:
;; 
;; ```clojure
;; (fn [f] (fn [g] (fn [x] (g (f x)))))
;; ```
;; Now we can apply this function a few times to see how it works:
;;}

((((fn [f] (fn [g] (fn [x] (g (f x)))))
   even?)                       ;; (==> int boolean)
  (fn [y] (if y "even" "odd"))) ;; (==> boolean string)
 42)
;; => "even"

;;{
;; We took our composition function, and provided the predicate `even?`
;; as the `f` function. As we comment above, this takes an `int` and returns a `boolean`.
;; Then, the `g` function that we use takes a `boolean` and returns a `string`.
;; Thus the composition `g°f` takes an `int` and returns a `string`, either
;; `"even"` if the input of `f` is even, and `"odd"` otherwise.
;;}

((((fn [f] (fn [g] (fn [x] (g (f x)))))
   even?)                       ;; (==> int boolean)
  (fn [y] (if y "even" "odd"))) ;; (==> boolean string)
 41)
;; => "odd"

;;{
;; This is also an important basic functional building block, and it is named `comp` in
;; the Clojure standard library.
;;}

((comp (fn [y] (if y "even" "odd")) even?) 42)
;; => "even"

((comp (fn [y] (if y "even" "odd")) even?) 41)
;; => "odd"

;;{
;; These are roughly the only things you need to know about Clojure
;; to begin exploring the LaTTe features.
;;}

;;{
;; ## Types, really ?

;;             /   / \   \
;;            \___/   \___/
;; ```
;;}

;;{
;; In the composition example above we did something rather unusual in Clojure:
;; we described the type of functions using the notation `(==> T U)` with `T` the
;; type of the input, and `U` the type of the returned value.
;;
;; As we'll quickly see, in a type theory the explicit mentioning of type becomes
;; an essential part of the mathematical language. As I often say if I am not
;; totally sold to the use of (static) types in programming (otherwise I would maybe
;; not use Clojure for starters), I am totally sold to the use of types in logic
;; and mathematics. I find much more interests in having a "set of integers" rather
;; than a "set" without further mentioning of the type of things I'll find as elements.
;; 
;; So if we want to define e.g. the identity function not directly in Clojure but
;; this time in LaTTe (which is also Clojure by the way), we will have to add some type annotations.
;; 
;; In LaTTe, `lambda` is called `lambda`, or `λ`, rather than `fn`. In this part of the tutorial
;; we will rather use the beautiful `λ` rather than its ascii spelling. This is to emphasis
;; that we are not yet at the user-level of the proof assistant, we only play with its λ-calculus kernel.
;; 
;; Thus our starting point is this:
;; 
;; ```clojure
;; ;; The identity function in latte (initial version)
;; (term
;;   (λ [x] x))
;;  --> Unhandled clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo
;;      Parse error
;;      {:msg "Wrong bindings in λ form",
;;       :term (λ [x] x),
;;       :from {:msg "Binding must have at least 2 elements", :term [x]}}
;; ```
;;}

;;{
;; The `term`  (or `latte.core/term`) form takes a LaTTe expression in input, parses it, typecheck's it
;; and returns the internal representation of the term as Clojure data.
;; As the exception raised by LaTTe makes clear, there is something missing in our identity function.
;; In fact we need to give an explicit type to the variable `x`, let's try with an arbitrary type named `A`:
;; 
;; ```clojure
;; (term
;;  (λ [x A] x))
;;  --> Unhandled clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo
;;      Type checking error
;;      {:msg "Cannot calculate codomain type of abstraction.",
;;       :term (λ [x A] x),
;;       :from {:msg "Cannot calculate type of variable.",
;;       :term x,
;;       :from {:msg "No such variable in type context", :term A}}}      
;; ```
;;}

;;{
;; As you can see LaTTe is quite verbose when something goes wrong,
;; which is rather a good thing when debugging mathematics!
;; Here we have a type error, and the ultimate reason is that
;; the variable `A` is defined nowhere.
;; 
;; What we would like is to make `A` an arbitrary type, so for
;; this we will add an extra layer of abstraction to our λ.
;;}

(term
 (λ [A :type] (λ [x A] x)))
;; => (λ [A ✳] (λ [x A] x))

;;{
;; This time the form evaluates! The `:type` keyword denotes the "type of all types".
;; Hence in LaTTe the (type-)generic identity function first takes an arbitrary type
;; `A` as a first argument, and returns a function that takes an arbibrary `x` of type
;; `A` to finally return `x` itself. That's generic as it can be!
;; 
;; The value returned by the `term` form (technically a Clojure macro) is the internal
;; representation of the terms in LaTTe. It's almost like what is written except that
;; the type of types is written `✳` internally.
;; Note also that if we use the ascii `lambda` we get the same result:
;;}

(term
 (lambda [A :type] (lambda [x A] x)))
;; => (λ [A ✳] (λ [x A] x))
